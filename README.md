# What's all this then?

This is an App Engine app written in Python 2.7 which displays artwork for [Autumn Christie Art](http://www.autumnchristieart.com). You need to install the Google SDK first, so try following the [getting started](https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/gettingstartedpython27/) guide.

Log in to your Google Account as Autumn Christie (you know who you are!) and visit [http://appengine.google.com](http://appengine.google.com) to see the admin tools.

All of the client code is in the `public` folder. Most of the server side code is  in `controllers` and `models.py`.
